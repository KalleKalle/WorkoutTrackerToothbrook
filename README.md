# WorkoutTrackerToothbrook

<b><i>A brief description</i></b>

This app is a Workout tracking app that should help the user track their workout, and compare their workouts with their friends.
Within the app it should be possible to create groups and compete within the groups to see who does best.

The reason for this idea is that my family has begun competing in who could work the most out in a month, and given points for each km run or walked and so on. 
So i thought instead of manually giving points and keeping track, i would develop an app that could do it for them.
